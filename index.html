		<h1>Solar Power for Ghana</h1>
		<h2>Working with businesses and home owners in Ghana to use solar power</h2>
		<p>Solar power is a clean, renewable and cost effective power solution. We help business owners, home owners, and government to design and install standard or custom solar power systems that meet their needs and budget.</p>
		<h2> Serving All of Ghana, and Nearby Borders!</h2>
		<p>We wanted to bring solar energy to people in Ghana at a good price. We will successfully deliver solar power solutions to you. We just started offering installations in Ghana. When possible we hope to expand service to other nearby countries, and maybe the entire continent. We would like to see Africa energy independent and free from fossil fuels and other energy resources that pollute our natural landscape.</p>

		<h1>Get Solar Power</h1>
		<h2>Solar Power Makes Good Sense</h2>
		<p>There are many reasons for businesses and Homes to use solar power. Solar power can reduce or eliminate a building’s electric bill. The systems have long term reliability and low maintenance costs, often lasting 25–40 years with little or no maintenance. It’s also good for the environment. So you help the planet, and being a “green” business today also makes your business more attractive to consumers.</p>
		<h2>Solar Power Your Home for Less Then You Think</h2>
		<p>With unrealiable power outages, it is good to have your own solar power so that you and the people in your village do not have to depend on the government sponsored electric services. You can store power and use it when you need it. Since the sun always shines in Ghana, you will have little or no worry when it comes to having your own power. The village can set up an array or solar panels so that electric power can be available to all home owners. You can even make your utility meter spin backwards. When your solar power system generates more electricity than you consume, your meter actually spins backwards, earning you credit with your utility company at the same rate they are charging you.</p>
		<h2>Solar Power for the Masses</h2>
		<p>We work with villages, town and provincial authorities and municipal governments to design, build and maintain solar power systems.</p>
